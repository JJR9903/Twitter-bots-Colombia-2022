Authors: Valentina Castilla, Santiago Herrera, Juan Diego Heredia, Juan José Rincón

We used Twitter API to download 5000 users that were actively holding debates about the presidential elections in Colombia - 2022. <br>
Afetwards we mark them as a Twitter Bot using Botometer, to train use a Random Forest model that we used to predict if an specific user was a Twitter Bot.
We used NLP to get some tweet content features: sentiment analysis and emojis analysis. Features about user account: # tweets , #retweets, #followers, #following accounts,minteraction with colombian politicians, mean time between tweets, etc.
